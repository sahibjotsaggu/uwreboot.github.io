				<h2> Stay Updated </h2>
				<h3> Join our Newsetter </h3>

				<h3> Follow us on Twitter </h3>
				<p> Do we even still have a twitter? Whatever, I'll take it out if we dont </p>
				<h3> Check out our Facebook Page </h3>
				<p> Okay yeah so is this still how we're going to do this? Or is facebook being phased out in favour of slack + website? </p>
				<hl/>
				<h2> Join the Conversation </h2>
				<h3> Join us on Slack </h3> 
				<p> So this is what slack is, its basically the thing that we use, so if you don't wanna use it, then you're pretty much screwed </p>
				<h3> Check out Rockstar Cafe </h3> 
				<p> So how exactly are we supposed to promote rockstar cafe? Like is there a specific way for us to link up with them or refer people. Should I be making an account sometime soon? </p>
				<hl/>
				<h2> Make a Difference </h3>
				<h3> Executive Positions </h3>
				<p> We should probably make a list of all of the exec positions that are available and make it clear what's going on </p>
				<h3> Directorships </h3>
				<p> We should probably make a list of all of the exec positions that are available and make it clear what's going on </p>
				<h3> Workshops </h3>
				<p> Perhaps we can advertise the workshops, and also mabye ask if anyone is willing to teach something to us. There are a lot of really cool people on campus... </p>
